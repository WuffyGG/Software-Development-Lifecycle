How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs and implement them in a program by collecting information from the users. This can be done with
interviews, surveys emails and other methods to collect information. Creating user stories helps with this as it organizes user needs
into something that can be implemented into a program. They keep user needs in a developemnt format that the team can use to implenment features.
These user stories can be broken down into manageable pieces that can allow collaboration and communication in developing
for the user.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs through understanding the problems and testing and creating working software early.
Planning out the workload allows there to be room for errors and mistakes that can be fixed in the development.
Agile processes I hope to incorporate in my future development work include, scrum events like sprints
and pair programming for better programming techniques. Scrum events will allow me to collaborate
and communicate well with other developers to achieve continous working code.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means having good communication and collaboration.
Without those two traits, you would be a terrible team member. Communication allows the team to
talk about what is going on in the project or what needs to be done. Collaboration allows
people to develop together or to communicate progress and what should be done together. Without
these two tratis, you might as well work alone and not in a team.
